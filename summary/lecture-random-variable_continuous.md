# Random Variables and Probability Functions (Continuous Variables: Part I)

## Detailed Topics to be covered

## Motivation

1. What is the issue when we study a continuous variable? Why is it different from a discrete variable? 
2. What are the possible solutions?

### Approach 1. Approximation and Complete Distribution Approach

1. How to approximate? Discretize a continuous variable
2. What is a **frequency distribution**?
3. What is **bandwidth**?

4. What is **probability density function** (pdf), as opposed to **probability mass function** (pmf)?
5. What are the properties of a pdf?
6. Different ways to visualize the pdf in `R`. 
    1. Traditional approach
    2. Tidy approach

7. What is **Quantile**? A rigorous definition of **quantile**.
8. Application in Risk Management

    1. Value at Risk (VaR)

9. Boxplot: Another way to visualize important distribution features.
